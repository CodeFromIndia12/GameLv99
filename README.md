Game Description

I think the word take a deep breath is more like stamina like after you run for so long you will stop and take a deep breath to recharge you energy back right?

In this game is more or less like that but with stamina system once it reach 0 player cannot attack anymore becaue too tired so it will take a deep breath to make the player go invisible during that time player cannot move but it also recharge the stamina in safe way
